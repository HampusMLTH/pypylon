Measurement started:
button clicked->label set to measureing
In consumer thread if label is set then initate measurement and print "START MEASURING"
move to position according to protocol and wait until there. 
wait untill we have a multiple of 9 images
delete all images in buffer(they are from movement)
(this part should be updated to remove a multipole of 9 not all...)
save_cb is set to true
9 images are appended to list  "images"
q.task_done on each image
starting "show_color_image" which should probably be renamed to handle 9_images or something
loop through 9 images and find the one with the lowest mean
append the index of the background image to a list led_background_list
check if the current background index is the same as the mean of the list
getting background image put first in list processed_image
add the rest of the images with background substract from and as float/dynamic range
background is normalized with dynamic range
make folder led_{}_stage_{}_sample_{}
write all the images with led wavelength and an iterator added to the filename
a colorimage is saved with the chosen bands.
Now done the "show color image" and back in consumer thread, set a new animation interval
top of consumer_thread and  goto "move to position according to protocol and wait until there."

comments: check dynamic range in tkinter
check what else differs
check if clear all q or 9 items
check whats done of the "todos"
check if stable with working lightsource
